We start our discussion of deep neural networks with the basic unit at the core of the model:

**The Perceptron**

---
class: middle

The perceptron was invented in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt.

We will see that it is quite similar to the basic formula used for SVM.

---
class: middle

A perceptron is a function that takes as input a vector $x$ and outputs a real number.

Its formula is given by

$$ h_{w,b}(x) = \phi(w^T x + b) $$

---
class: middle

$x$ are the input variables. 

This is the data used to make our prediction.

---
class: middle

$w$ and $b$ are parameters to optimize.

- $w$ is called the weight vector / matrix.
- $b$ is called the bias. It shifts $w^T x$ by a constant.

---
class: middle

There are many different choices for $\phi$ but most choices are associated with the idea of neuron activation and threshold activation.

---
class: middle

- **Activation:** the neuron is either on or off.
- **Threshold:** the neuron is off below a certain value and on above.

---
class: middle

Mathematically, $\phi(z)$ is 

- close to 0 when $z < 0$, and 
- increases rapidly to 1 when $z > 0$.

---
class: middle

The simplest example is the heaviside function.

---
class: middle

This function has some limitations that make it unsuitable for our optimization algorithms.

In particular, the slope is always 0.

---
class: middle

Researchers have tried a variety of activation functions $\phi$ with better properties.

Some common choices are.

Comments:

- sigmoid and tanh are very similar up to scaling and shifting
- relu has zero derivative when $x<0$ which can cause some numerical problems for certain optimization algorithms.

---
class: middle

Mathematical definitions

- heaviside$(x)$: 0 if $x<0$; 1 otherwise.
- sigmoid$(x) = \sigma(x) = 1/( 1 + \exp(-x))$
- tanh$(x) = 2 \sigma(2x) - 1$
- ReLU$(x) = \max(0,x)$

---
class: middle

# Optimization

How can we optimize $w$ and $b$ given some data?

---
class: middle

We first need to define a loss function

$$ L(w,b) = \sum_{i=1}^m ( y_i - \phi(w^T x_i + b) )^2 $$

---
class: middle

We can minimize the error by using a gradient descent method:

$$ \Delta w = - \alpha \; \frac{\partial L}{\partial w}, 
\hspace{2em} \Delta b = - \alpha \; \frac{\partial L}{\partial b} $$

$\alpha$ = learning rate; $\Delta w$ and $\Delta b$ are increments in $w$ and $b$.

---
class: middle

 Notation:

- $y_i$: training data
- $\hat{y}_i = \phi(w^T x_i + b)$: prediction using perceptron

---
class: middle

$$ L(w,b) = \sum\_{i=1}^m ( y\_i - \phi(w^T x\_i + b) )^2 = \sum\_{i=1}^m ( y\_i - \hat{y}\_i )^2 $$

Derivative with respect to $w$:

$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial w} = 2 \sum_{i=1}^m ( \hat{y}_i - y_i ) \; \phi'(w^T x_i + b) \; x_i
$$

---
class: middle

$$ L(w,b) = \sum_{i=1}^m ( y_i - \phi(w^T x_i + b) )^2 $$

Derivative with respect to $b$:

$$ \frac{\partial L}{\partial b} = 2 \sum_{i=1}^m ( \hat{y}_i - y_i ) \; \phi'(w^T x_i + b) $$

---
class: middle

If you choose $\phi$ to be a linear function, you can recognize that a perceptron is doing a linear regression of the data.

That is, it tries to fit a hyperplane to the data by minimizing the mean squared error.

---
class: middle

With a non-linear function $\phi$ we can build more general surfaces that fit the data but this is clearly very limited.

---
class: middle

Consider for example the XOR function:

Input 1 | Input 2 | Output
--- | --- | ---
0 | 0 | 0
1 | 1 | 0
0 | 1 | 1
1 | 0 | 1

---
class: middle

Can you build a perceptron that reproduces this data?

Unfortunately, this is **not possible.**

---
class: middle

This has led to the idea of stacking perceptrons together to create multilayered perceptrons or MLP.

## Caption of figure

The $\sum$ symbol corresponds to the linear matrix-vector multiplication $W^{(i+1)} x^{(i)}$.

$x^{(i)}$ are the activation values for layer $i$.

It's a vector. The size of $x^{(i)}$ is the number of nodes in layer $i$.

---
class: middle

$$W^{(i+1)} x^{(i)}$$

$W^{(i+1)}$ is a matrix.

The number of columns of $W^{(i+1)}$ is the size of $x^{(i)}$.

The number of rows of $W^{(i+1)}$ is the size of the next layer, $x^{(i+1)}$.

---
class: middle

The 1 corresponds to adding the bias $b^{(i+1)}$:

$$W^{(i+1)} x^{(i)} + b^{(i+1)}$$

$b^{(i+1)}$ is now a vector. Its size is the same as $x^{(i+1)}$.

---
class: middle

After the linear transformation 

$$W^{(i+1)} x^{(i)} + b^{(i+1)}$$ 

we apply a non-linear activation function $\phi$:

$$z^{(i+1)}\_j = [ W^{(i+1)} x^{(i)} + b^{(i+1)} ]_j $$

$$x^{(i+1)}_j = \phi(z^{(i+1)}_j) $$

---
class: middle

This type of structure is called an **artificial neural network** or ANN.

---
class: middle

Generally speaking, an ANN is a general graph, that is directed (information only goes in one direction) and acyclic (no cycles).

Each edge $e$ corresponds to a multiplication by some weight $w_e$.

Multiple incoming edges are summed up together.

Then a non-linear function $\phi$ is applied to the result.

# Example of DAG with 5 nodes

class: center, middle

![:height 40vh](2020-04-08-17-30-39.png)

---
class: middle

But in most cases, ANNs are organized in layers as we have seen previously.

---
class: center, middle

![:width 50vw](2020-04-08-16-11-32.png)

---
class: middle

At each layer we perform the sequence of operations:

- Input: $x^{(i)}$
- Multiply by weights and add bias:

$$z^{(i+1)}\_j = [ W^{(i+1)} x^{(i)} + b^{(i+1)} ]_j $$

- Apply non-linear function: 

$$x^{(i+1)}_j = \phi(z^{(i+1)}_j) $$

---
class: middle

A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network that has many such layers (it is "deep").

It was discovered that making ANNs deep was the key to their success.

---
class: middle

As more layers are added, the ANN is capable of performing more and more complex tasks.

At this point, this is a somewhat empirical observation although there are now several research papers that have investigated this question.

---
class: middle

DNNs are behind many success stories such as 

- [AlphaGo](https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far), 
- Apple's [Siri](https://machinelearning.apple.com/) voice recognition, and
- [YouTube recommendations](https://research.google/pubs/pub45530/).

We will discuss this point in more details later on.

# Training and optimization of DNNs

---
class: middle

As we have seen previously with the perceptron, based on some training data $(x_i,y_i)$, we can optimize the weights $W^{(i)}$ and biases $b^{(i)}$ to minimize the error.

---
class: middle

Before we discuss how to do this, let's start with a simple implementation in Keras/TensorFlow of a DNN.
