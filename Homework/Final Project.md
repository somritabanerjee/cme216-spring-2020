title: Final Project
---

At the end of the quarter, you are expected to submit a 5-page report on a final project of your choosing. The report for your project should involve at least the following components:

1. 5 points. Description of the engineering topic you chose; the choice of topics is open but it should be related to an engineering problem, rather than a pure computer science topic, such as image, speech, or vision.
1. 10 points. Describe the technical problem of interest and its difficulties.
1. 10 points. Review the published literature and available approaches that are relevant to your problem.
1. 20 points. Propose and describe the algorithm that you picked to solve your problem. This should be preferably a published method or a known technique that has been tested and validated before, in order to limit last-minute surprises. It is best to focus on methods covered during this quarter such as support vector machines, deep neural networks, physics-informed neural networks, etc.
1. 20 points. Implement your method using your language and framework of choice. You can use TensorFlow or PyTorch. Reusing existing code is fine but you must cite your sources and describe the changes and additions you have made to the code. Turn in your code with your assignment. This does not count against the length of the report.
1. 5 points. Describe the steps you have taken to verify that your code is correctly implementing the algorithm.
1. 10 points. Choose and describe the datasets, problem settings and parameters that you used for your code validation and benchmarks.
1. 15 points. Plot and present the results of your benchmarks. Discuss and interpret the results. Make sure you explore a range of inputs and algorithm parameters to give a good sense of how the method performs.
1. 5 points. Discuss the limitations of the proposed approach and some ideas to improve it.

We recommend to keep it simple. Start with a modest project and clearly achievable goals. Then if all goes well, you can add "bonus" results. It is better to start simple and add later, than start with an ambitious goal and then abandon it for something much simpler at the last minute.

To help you plan ahead and make sure that you will be on track for the deadline, we request that you submit a plan for your final project. See gradescope for the deadline. This plan is worth 10 points. This plan should be a one page document describing:

1. A general description of the project you envision.
1. A brief literature survey of relevant methods that apply to your problem.
1. A timeline of the tasks to complete, with dates, until the successful submission of your project at the end of the quarter.

There is an option to work in teams on a project. I recommend teams of at most 2 students. 3 students is an option but it is discouraged. 4 or more is not allowed. The amount of work you put into the project must be the same whether or not you are part of a team.

For teams of 2 students, you should submit an 8-page report. Teams of 3 should submit a 10-page report. Each member of the team must submit a PDF of the project on gradescope, separately. This PDF must be **the same** for all team members. The list of all team members should be shown in the PDF, at the beginning.

In addition, each member of the team must submit a short document that contains:

1. A description of what each team member contributed to the project. Include yourself.
1. For each team member, indicate whether in your opinion you believe this team member contributed [a lot less/less/same/more/a lot more] time/effort than the other team members. Include yourself.

Everyone should give their own opinion without necessarily communicating with the other team members.

The results of this survey will be used to adjust individual grades between team members if needed.
