title: Partial Solutions to Reading Assignments 16-20
---

Here are the solutions to trickier questions from these reading assignments.

**RA16**

Q1: the error is proportional to $O(ux) = O(u)$.

Q2: When computing $f(x+h)$ we have already made an error in $x+h$. So we are computing in fact

$$f(x+h + O(u)) = f(x+h) + f'(x+h) O(u) = f(x+h) + O(u)$$

The roundoff error when evaluating $f$ is $O(uf)$. So in the end the total error is $O(u)$.

Q3: The numerator is $f(x+h) - f(x-h)$. We first observe that we made an error in $O(u)$ when evaluating the function $f$ numerically. Also, as $h$ gets small, $f(x+h) - f(x-h)$ goes to zero (in absence of roundoff errors). 

When $h$ is large compared to $u$, the magnitude of $f(x+h) - f(x-h) + O(u)$ is $O(f) = O(1)$. When $h$ is comparable to $u$, the numerator is of order $O(u)$. When $h$ is very small compared to $u$, we get something different. $x+h = x-h$ in that case because we only carry a limited number of digits. So in fact, the numerator is numerically exactly equal to 0.

Take $h>u$. There are now two errors when computing the ratio. There is an error in $O(u/h)$ because of the error in the numerator, and an error in $O(u/h)$ from the roundoff error when doing the division. So overall, the error is of order $O(u/h)$.

When $h \ll u$, the numerator is 0 so the error is just $O(1)$.

Q4: If $h= 10^{-6}$, and $u=10^{-8}$, we get $u/h = 10^{-2}$. So we can expect approximately two digits of accuracy. When $h = 10^{-16}$, the numerator is numerically exactly equal to 0. So the error is of order 1. We have no significant digits at all in the numerical prediction for the derivative.

Q5: $d/dx (\text{tanh}(1+x^2)) = 2x / \text{cosh}^2(1+x^2)$

Q6: $x^2+1 = 2$, $(x^2+1)' = 2xx' = 16$

Q7: 

$$\text{tanh}(1+x^2) = \text{tanh}(2) = 0.964$$

$$d/dx (\text{tanh}(1+x^2)) = 2xx' / \text{cosh}^2(1+x^2) = 16/\text{cosh}^2(2) = 1.13$$

Q2&3: Note the questions are referring to the generic computational graph in slide with n nodes.

For question 2, we want to traverse the graph from left to right in forward mode. Using the given chain rule relation, we can initialize the derivative to be $$ \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = 1 $$. Then, in for a loop with i going from 1 to n, we update  $$ \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \leftarrow \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \times \frac{\partial z_i}{\partial z_{i-1}} $$, with $$ z_n = y, z_0 = x $$. 

For question 3, we want to traverse the graph from right to left in forward mode. Using the given chain rule relation, we can again initialize the derivative to be $$ \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = 1 $$. Then, in for a loop with i going from n down to 1, we update  $$ \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \leftarrow \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} \times \frac{\partial z_i}{\partial z_{i-1}} $$, with $$ z_n = y, z_0 = x $$.

Note that despite the two algorithms look very similar, the orders of computation are reversed, making each more efficient in specific cases as we see in following questions.

Q4-7: Depending on your interpretation, you might get different numeric answers. But using forward mode in one-to-many and using backward mode in many-to-one should result in shorter computation time, due to the ability to reuse shared intermediate values; in these two cases, only one traversal is needed for all the hidden nodes.
